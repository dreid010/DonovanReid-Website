        <p class="lead mb-4"> For me giving up is a missed chance to improve myself and learn from my mistakes. Even if I fail, I will get back up and figure out a way to get past the struggle. I feel it‚Äôs like trying to climb a tall mountain. It‚Äôs a hard task, but it‚Äôs one you will get stronger from once completed. You have to deal with your feelings and pains to get to the top. Even though I am a quiet kid, I am very competitive. I naturally try to be the best in any situation. I think this trait came from my days participating in Taekwondo. I started out as a white belt, looking up at the mountain I had to climb to get a black belt. At first, I never thought I would be able to make it to the top. There were so many levels I had to climb, and each level up became harder than the one before. With the encouragement of my dad, my mindset  shifted. It started with I can‚Äôt,  to I could,  finally I have done.  I like to learn from people to better myself. In return  I teach others what I know so they become better rivals. I learned to use competition as a means to get better. It was the constant struggle to improve that made me better. After receiving my black belt I left Taekwondo as time and money became scarce. I decided to treat my school work with the same mindset as I did with Taekwondo. I like to have competitions with my friends to get the highest test score or the fastest mile time. Which enables us to get even better.

        The greatest challenge I‚Äôve ever faced occured in my junior year. My mom and I  lived in my great-grandmother‚Äôs house. My mom was passionate to move into her own home. This happened when my mom married her childhood friend and we moved into an apartment in Moreno Valley. Everything seemed like it was going well on the surface, but this was a turning point in my life. It was decided that I would continue to attend school in Rancho Cucamonga.The problem with staying in my school in Rancho was that I would have to switch between three houses during the week. We developed a schedule. Monday and Tuesday I was with my Mom. Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday I was with my great-grandma .  Friday afternoon, Saturday and Sunday I was with my Dad.  I‚Äôd often have to get up at around 5 am  to make it to school on time. My classes made things more difficult. I took the challenge of AP Chemistry, AP US History, and Precalculus. For band, there was a zero period practice everyday and on Tuesdays and Thursdays practices from 5:30 - 9 pm.My mom would often find me asleep in my room with AP textbooks open and sprawled around the floor with pages of unfinished homework. I‚Äôd fight to stay awake in my classes because I often stayed up late trying to finish homework. The passion I had to excel in my classes motivated me to get past the hardships. Through this trial I learned to manage my time better, and I learned how to better* coordinate with multiple people. I learned to work right the first time instead of complaining. I didn‚Äôt want everything I had worked so hard for to wither away. I wanted to be as good as some of my peers. If this meant I would have to work twice as hard as them, I would. The struggle I had faced made me a stronger student. The entire predicament was difficult, but I‚Äôm glad that I reaped benefits.

History is my favorite subject. My Dad sparked an early interest in history by allowing me to play a game called Civilization . Civilization is a turn based strategy game based upon the history of various historical cultures and nations.  At first Civilization was just a fun game to play. However the deeper I delved, the more curious I became about the world that was before us. I started asking my Dad questions, and he always told me to look up the questions myself. So I read about all sorts of things. ‚ÄúWhat was the Roman Empire?‚Äù,  How did America gain its independence? ‚Äù , ‚ÄúWho were the Bantu?‚Äù. I was fascinated about everything I read. I quickly learned that history isn‚Äôt a straight forward subject. It constructs itself on many variables that all contribute to the bigger picture. Each of these variables tell a tale of their own. Every action made is like a stroke of a paint brush. Every stroke dictates what the painting will look like. It was my love for history that motivated me to work the polls on the November 6 midterm election. Normally, I don‚Äôt really pay much attention to politics. It just seemed  fake and convoluted  to me. But despite that, I decided that working the polls could teach me something I had not yet experienced.  I was interested to see how the voting process really worked. I learned that day the importance of voting in America. Every person who voted or stayed silent  that day made a difference in American history. I learned it was important to keep updated on the way the government is moving. For the people that are elected set the direction the country moves. Voting is one of the defining features in the USA, and being apart of it made me feel special.  I was a little speck of the painting that shapes the direction of our country. Working on the polls furthered my interest and understanding of history. I am glad I had the opportunity to participate in a big part of American history.
